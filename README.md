# Django-simple-inventory-system
A simple inventory management system that allows user to manage and maintain his/her inventory with ease. This system has been developed to allow users to add an inventory, delete an inventory, enter inventory quantity and other details, update inventory status and more.

#DEASCRIPTION: 
The simple inventory management solution is designed to cater to the inventory control and management needs of small to medium businesses. This system enables the users to perform stock receiving and dispatch through on-demand mobile printing and item scanning as well as visibility of inventory stocks at one glance.
This day's many companies require an inventory system either to improve their quality of service and/or to have better control and management of merchants and tools. So this project stands as a show of skill and open source project.
